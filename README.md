# Queer Data Days

Hi! I'm Isabella Lu, a second year at the University of Virginia. 

Recently I was presented an opportunity to present my findings at the Queer Data Days Conference where I shared about Gender Profiling in Wikidata. 

Attached in this repository is my presentation as well as the code I used to generate the plots within the presentation. 

# Code Languages Used 

- For initial queries: SPARQL programming language
- For analytical graphs: R programming language

Enjoy!
