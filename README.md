# Queer Data Days

Hi! I'm Isabella Lu, a second year at the University of Virginia, studying under Professor Peter Alonzi and Wikimedian-in-Residence Lane Rasberry in the University's School of Data Science. 

I was recently given an opportunity to present my findings at the Queer Data Days Conference where I shared about Gender Profiling in Wikidata. The objective of the presentation was to showcase Wiki's data and how representative it is of modern-day society. Within it are plots that narrow in on the gender distribution within certain occupations that are compared to data outside of Wikipedia. 

Attached in this repository is my presentation as well as all the code I used to generate the plots within the presentation. 

# Code Languages Used 

- For initial queries: SPARQL programming language
- For analytical graphs: R programming language

Enjoy!
